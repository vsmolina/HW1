## Overview and Origin
![logo](images/zillow.png)

## Zillow Group Inc.
- Incorporated in 2004
- Founded by **Richard Garton** and **Lloyd Frink**
- Zillow is beginning to really embrace the field of FinTech as they want to buy and flip houses, and endeavor that is extremely captital intensive. The purpose of this endeavor is for home owners to feel more flexible about moving to another home. Zillow will buy the homes of its customers, fix and sell them in-house.
- The company is public and is funded by working capital and shareholders

## Business Activities:

- The company is trying to solve the fact that homeowners are stuck in their homes because they are unable to sell their home.
- Like another FinTech start up *OpenDoor*, Zillow is attempting to enter the real estate home flipping market at a large scale, enabeling homeowners to essentially "trade-in their home". This is targeted at the average homeowners, and anyone who simply wants to get cash for a home.
- Zillow uses *python* and *java* to code, and applications and data services include *Amazon EC2*, *Amazon S3*, *Android SDK*, *RabbitMQ*, *Flask*, *Swift*, *Apache Tomcat*, *Objective-C*, *Spring*, and *Imgix*.
- Although I am unfamiliar with most of these technologies, these applications facilitate the application building of their online presence, as well as the managing and maintaining of the applications.

## Landcape:

- Zillow is involved in real estate
- Lately, a trend in FInTech Real Estate has been to engage with customers directly and allow ease of transaction when dealing with real estate. Companies sush as NestEgg who deals with connecting landlords with their customers a breeze and collectiing rent payments easy.
- A huge part of real estate is mortgage and lending, as well as Tech brokerage, online marketing, property management, and real estate agent tools

## Results:

- The biggeest impact on the Real Estate market come from the ease of transactions, ease of viewing properties, and data analysis of the current real estate market and projections.
- Zillow measures its success by the amount of houses it is able to resell, not just buy. The company is currently at its launch of the buying and reselling service, and many people believe it to flop. Zillow currently holds way too many houses in inventory, and is having trouble finding customers for those houses.
